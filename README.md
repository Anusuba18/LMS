Project Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the operations of a traditional library. Managing books and user records manually often results in inefficiencies such as tracking issues, missed return dates, and difficulty in monitoring new arrivals. This system provides an integrated platform where both administrators and students can manage and access library resources effectively.
The system was developed using PHP and MySQL for backend data management and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a user-friendly and responsive front-end interface.

Objectives

To digitalize and streamline the management of library operations.
To enable efficient tracking of issued and returned books and to reduce manual errors.
To notify users of due dates and penalties to ensure timely book returns.
To provide visibility into newly added books and improve student engagement with library resources.

Problem Statement

Manual library operations often lead to:
Difficulty in tracking borrowed books and user activity.
Missed deadlines, causing fines and confusion over book availability.
Lack of communication between the library and students regarding new or available resources.
The absence of an automated system limits operational efficiency and the overall user experience.
